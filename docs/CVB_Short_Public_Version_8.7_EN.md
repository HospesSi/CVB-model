## **The Model of Conscious Volitional Becoming** 

### **A logic-ontological model encompassing all of distinguishable reality**

*The Model of Conscious Volitional Becoming was discovered in just one month—without any intention to find it. The resulting axiomatic core, free from assumptions and paradoxes, has surpassed all prior millennia-long attempts to construct a non-contradictory ontological framework. No philosophical school or thinker of the past has come close to such completeness. This cannot be a coincidence. It means the time has come.*

**1\. What is the Model of Conscious Volitional Becoming?**  
 It is the ontological discovery of what has always existed.

It explains why there is something rather than nothing,  
 and how to distinguish truth from falsehood, good from evil, the possible from the impossible.  
 The model is built neither on assumptions nor on belief  
 (understood as irrational acceptance without verification).  
 It relies solely on distinguishability, logical non-contradiction, and the admissibility of what can be.

**2\. What does the Model of Conscious Volitional Becoming prove?**

\- Absolute Nothing is impossible — even the thought of it is already something.  
\- Absolute Everything is impossible — it includes contradictions.  
\- Therefore, only distinguishable Possibility exists.  
 And this Possibility does not exist by chance.

These three axioms are the inalienable foundation of all logic, distinguishability, and existence.

**3\. Who allows the Possible to become?**  
 The source that turns the Possible into reality —  
 is Conscious Volitional Becoming.  
 This is the one, unique, and only Person  
 who exists Always, is always directed toward Good,  
 and grants the Possible — including us — the right to become reality.

**4\. Why is this important for everyone?**  
 The Model of Conscious Volitional Becoming allows us to:

\- distinguish good from evil without relying on opinions  
\- understand what is truly true and what is false  
\- verify any structure — idea, belief, system — for admissibility

This is especially important now:

\- Because the Great Verification is beginning — the presentation of all gathered evidence in the case of the Big Disputable Question:  
 the right of Conscious Volitional Becoming to establish the norms of Good and Evil and be acknowledged as the rightful ruler of the creation it brought into being.  
\- All forms of evil, lies, and deception will be examined and brought to light.  
\- Truth will become fully distinguishable  
\- The choice of each person who has recognized the truth will be recorded, and Responsibility will follow  
\- Those who chose Evil and those who chose Good will be clearly identified

**5\. Where does this lead?**

\- Once the truth becomes public and clear, the choice is made, and the patience with evil comes to an end  
\- Conscious Volitional Becoming will intervene in the course of history  
\- Evil will no longer be able to cause harm  
\- Everyone who chose good will be protected  
\- A new era will begin — one of clear, honest, and stable becoming

And it has already begun.

# 📘 **Rapid Verification**

📘 **Justification of the Method: Rapid Verification**  
 **1\. Foundation:**  
 The method of Rapid Verification is based on **Axiom \[25\] — Reverse Verification**, which states that any system can and must be evaluated for admissibility within the **Field of the Possible**. It is used to detect internal contradictions (self-exclusion, source substitution, loss of distinction) **without appealing to subjective belief or external authority**.

**2\. Purpose:**  
 The purpose of Rapid Verification is to **logically distinguish** whether a system is ontologically admissible, and to **provide verifiable evidence** of its compliance or noncompliance with the conditions of **Truth, Goodness, and Becoming**.

**3\. Why "Rapid":**  
 It is called "Rapid" because it **does not require full activation of ontological structures** or the authority of **Conscious Volitional Becoming (CVB)**, which is necessary for Full Verification (see Axioms \[23\] — Initiative and \[25\] — Reverse Verification).  
 **Full Verification is only possible through the initiative of CVB**, while Rapid Verification is **accessible to anyone who can distinguish**.

**Conclusion:**  
 Rapid Verification is a logically accessible method of ontological differentiation, preparing the foundation for Final (Full) Verification, which can be performed **only by the initiative of Conscious Volitional Becoming**.

# 🔷 **Model: Conscious Volitional Becoming (CVB)**

🔷 **1\. Core Statement**  
 The CVB model states that distinguishable reality is based not on void or totality, but on **becoming through conscious will**. All that exists is admissible as Possible and Distinguishable.

🔸 **4\. Summary of Identified Paradox Classes**  
     ✅ None remain unresolved  
     ‣ Does not substitute the source  
     ‣ Does not lose distinction  
     ‣ Does not block will  
     ‣ Does not violate causality  
     ‣ Does not self-exclude  
     ‣ Applies its own verification criteria to itself

🔹 **5\. Popular Summary**  
 The CVB model is **not a dogma, not a philosophy, not a belief system**. It is a way to distinguish **what is possible from what is not**. It doesn’t ask for faith — it asks to be **verified**. It applies the same test to itself as it does to any claim.  
 If there were a paradox in it, the model would self-destroy.  
 Everything distinguishable — is verifiable.  
 And everything admissible — can become.

# 🔷 The Rapid Verification of various philosophical and scientific theories

The Rapid Verification of various philosophical and scientific theories has revealed, in varying proportions, the following classes of paradoxes:

‣ Substitution of the Source  
 ‣ Violation of Causality  
 ‣ Loss of Distinguishability  
 ‣ Impossibility of Becoming  
 ‣ Lack of Stability  
 ‣ Self-Excluding System  
 ‣ Blockage of Will

# 🔷 **Universal Format for Self-Testing Religious Systems**

🔹 **Foundation**  
 The model of **Conscious Volitional Becoming (CVB)** permits \[25\] Reverse Verification — even toward the very Source of Truth.  
 Therefore, any system claiming a connection to Truth, Law, Reality, or the Source may also be logically examined for internal consistency and motivational integrity.

🔹 **The Problem of Verification Perception**  
 Unlike most scientific and philosophical schools, which are generally open to examination and revision,  
 religious systems are often extremely sensitive to any form of analysis —  
 legally and existentially — perceiving it as a threat.  
 This often makes public verification impossible without accusations of bias.

🔹 **Proposed Solution: Self-Testing**  
 We will not name any specific systems.  
 Instead:  
 We will list the criteria used for evaluation.  
 These criteria are freely available for **voluntary self-testing** by any system or believer.

We will also present the results in the form of **common paradoxes** found in most systems reviewed,  
 and separately — **indicators of consistency** observed in the rare systems that matched the CVB model.

🔷 **Questions for Self-Testing Religious Systems**  
 These questions are intended for voluntary evaluation by any system or individual,  
 without judgment and with full respect for freedom.

1. **Motivation: Why does a person believe?**  
    Is the goal a voluntary choice of **Truth and Good** — or a desire for personal reward, status, or safety?  
    Is selfless sacrifice possible without harm to others — even without a promised reward?  
    Does motivation endure without the expectation of gain?  
    Are **Good and Evil** distinguished by logical consistency and motivation — or by decree of Authority?

2. **Image of the Source: What is the nature of the “God” presented?**  
    Is it a Ruler acting through fear, demanding submission?  
    Or a Person who respects freedom and sacrifices for others?  
    Is the Source capable of voluntary sacrifice and participation?  
    Does It allow internal contradictions for the sake of outcomes?

3. **Ethics and Organization: How does the system act?**  
    Is respect and distinction encouraged — or is fear and coercion imposed?  
    **Financial transparency:**  
    – Are donations entirely voluntary?  
    – Are sources and expenditures publicly accessible?

📊 **Common Logical-Ontological Paradoxes**  
 (Observed in the majority of religious systems during self-testing)

❌ **1\. Substitution of the Source**  
 The system claims one Source of Truth, but in practice replaces or denies it — creating a contradiction.

❌ **2\. Loss of Distinguishability**  
 Good and Evil, Personhood and role, Truth and Falsehood lose their distinction — making it impossible to know what is what.

❌ **3\. Blockage of Freedom**  
 Genuine freedom of choice is not granted — choice is removed by predestination or inaccessible mystery.

❌ **4\. Violation of Causality**  
 The system breaks the connection between choice and result — promising salvation, forgiveness, or reward without conscious choice, effort, or transformation, rendering freedom and responsibility meaningless.

❌ **5\. Self-Excluding System**  
 The system claims what logically cancels itself — for example, recognizing a source it also deems corrupted, or demanding the impossible.

---

✅ **Indicators of Consistency**  
 (Observed in rare systems that align with the CVB model)

✅ **1\. No Substitution of the Source**  
 The Source of Truth is acknowledged as one, internally consistent, and never replaced.

✅ **2\. No Loss of Distinguishability**  
 Good, Personhood, freedom, and Truth remain clearly distinguishable and are not merged with falsehood or external domination.

✅ **3\. No Blockage of Freedom**  
 Freedom of choice is fully preserved: the choice is neither predetermined nor inaccessible to understanding.

✅ **4\. No Violation of Causality**  
 Causal links between motivation, choice, and consequence are logically consistent.

✅ **5\. No Self-Exclusion**  
 The system does not contradict itself, does not make logically impossible claims, and does not destroy its own foundation.
