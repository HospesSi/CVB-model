## **The Model of Conscious Volitional Becoming** 

### **A logic-ontological model encompassing all of distinguishable reality**

*The Model of Conscious Volitional Becoming was discovered in just one month—without any intention to find it. The resulting axiomatic core, free from assumptions and paradoxes, has surpassed all prior millennia-long attempts to construct a non-contradictory ontological framework. No philosophical school or thinker of the past has come close to such completeness. This cannot be a coincidence. It means the time has come.*

# Preface (Simplified)

You are holding a description of a unique model — **Conscious Volitional Becoming (CVB)**.  
 It is not a philosophical hypothesis nor a scientific theory in the conventional sense.  
 It is a logically derived and ontologically complete structure of reality,  
 allowing us to distinguish truth from falsehood, good from evil, and the possible from the impossible.

The model does not require belief (if belief means irrational acceptance without verification).  
 It can be tested, understood, and applied.  
 It will serve as the foundation for an important evaluation — the **Accelerated Verification**.

---

# Disclaimer (Simplified)

This publication is intended for everyone capable of discerning and choosing.  
 It does not violate anyone’s rights, but it **places responsibility on the reader**:

* To **understand**, if you seek truth.  
* To **challenge**, if you disagree — but with arguments.  
* To **accept or reject** — as a conscious act of will.

From the moment a person recognizes truth **as truth**,  
 their choice is registered.  
 Regardless of when or how one accessed it,  
 the **response to discerned truth** becomes **ontologically significant**.

Every choice you make will be taken into account  
 at the conclusion of the **Big Question**.

This is the first publication of its kind.  
 Its goal is not to explain everything, but to provide enough to distinguish.  
**Translations into different languages may introduce difficulties in understanding — but don’t worry: only what is truly understood is registered as a choice.**

# Section: Permanent Possible

# \[I\] The Core — The Ontological Irrefutability of the Trilemma

* **Absolute Nothingness is impossible** — even thinking of it is already something.

* **Absolute Everything is impossible** — it includes contradictions.

* Therefore, only the **discernible Possible** exists.  
   And this Possible does not exist by chance.

These three axioms form the **irrevocable foundation** of all logic, discernment, and existence.

---

# \[1\] Absolute Nothingness is Impossible

Imagine that there is absolutely nothing.  
 But in order to imagine that, you are already doing something.  
 So “nothing” is already not complete.  
 If we can’t even say “nothing exists,” then **true Nothingness never occurs**.  
 It **cannot be** — not even in imagination. Because anything conceivable is already something.

**Examples:**

* **Logic**: The empty set is a logical construct — not "nothing".

* **Physics**: Quantum vacuum contains fluctuations and fields.

* **Everyday life**: “There is nothing here” always implies a context (e.g., "in the room", "on the table").

* **Thought**: You cannot think “nothing” without a mental act — which is already being.

---

# \[2\] Absolute Everything is Impossible

If **everything** is true, then “everything is false” must also be true.  
 But if **true and false** are the same, then nothing is distinguishable.  
 Truth would lose all meaning.  
 Such a world cannot exist.

**Examples:**

* **Science**: If all hypotheses were true, science would collapse.

* **Physics**: Not all processes are allowed — otherwise laws would vanish.

* **Everyday life**: If a person were always both alive and dead — life would lose all meaning.

* **Informatics**: If True \= False, code breaks.  
   **The separation between truth and falsehood is the foundation of every functional system.**

---

# \[3\] Only the Possible Exists

If something contradicts itself, it cannot be real.  
 If there were a square circle, or a truth that denies itself — it would destroy the very **possibility** of thought, understanding, and speech.  
 Therefore, all that truly exists must be understandable and must not break logic.  
 Only the **possible** is real.

**Examples:**

* **Logic**:  
   The liar paradox ("I am lying") cannot be true — it erases the boundary between truth and falsehood ⇒ **impossible**.

* **Science**: No theory allows 1 \= 2\. That contradiction would destroy mathematics ⇒ **the impossible does not occur**.

* **Everyday life**:  
   A person who is both alive and dead in the same way would be absurd — not life.

* **Physics**:  
   Violations of causality (e.g., effect without cause) are excluded from real models ⇒ **impossible**.

# \[II\] Properties

# \[4\] The Field of the Possible and Its Boundaries

Some things are **always possible** — such as truth, discernibility, and logic.  
 They can never disappear. They are the foundation of everything.

Some things are **always impossible** — such as Absolute Nothingness.  
 It cannot “be,” because then it wouldn’t be nothing anymore.  
 This is what we call **Permanent**.

Some things are **not always possible**.  
 They emerge — and either continue developing or disappear.  
 This is called **Non-Permanent**.

Example: **Flight.** It didn’t exist, and then it became possible.  
 Society develops such things because they bring benefit and stability.  
 The more they are repeated, the more stable they become.

Now consider **murder**. Before the first murderer, it didn’t exist.  
 But once it occurred, it became clear: it leads to destruction and instability.  
 The more it is repeated, the more society realizes its harm and acts to prevent its recurrence, isolating those who commit it.

**Thus, all non-permanent phenomena tend either toward stable existence or toward stable disappearance.**  
 This axiom helps us distinguish the temporary from the eternal — and understand the direction each phenomenon leads toward.

**Examples:**

* **Permanent Impossible:**  
    The existence of Absolute Nothingness — cannot occur under any condition.

* **Non-Permanent Impossible → Permanent Impossible:**  
    The emergence of the **first murderer**.  
    Before rational beings existed, murder was impossible. Once it happened, it became a **Non-Permanent Impossible** that actualized once and shifted into **Permanent Impossible** — no one can ever become the first murderer again.

* **Non-Permanent Possible:**  
    Human flight. Impossible before the invention of flying machines, later became real and widespread.

* **Permanent Possible:**  
    The law of non-contradiction. It cannot be bypassed without destroying logic itself.

# \[5\] The Possible ≠ The Existing

Imagine standing before a vast menu — it lists thousands of dishes, but you can only choose one.  
 All the dishes represent the **Possible**.  
 What you order is the **Existing**.  
 You don’t lose freedom by not eating everything.  
 On the contrary — because there is choice, you can choose.

The world works the same way: the Possible is greater than what has already come to be.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:** Mathematical induction assumes a potentially infinite set of cases — even when proving them one by one.

* **Physics:** The laws allow countless configurations of particles — but only one is realized.

* **Biology:** DNA allows millions of combinations — but produces one concrete organism.

* **Everyday life:** You can imagine thousands of paths — but walk only one. The others were possible, but not realized.

* **Ethics:** The possibility of committing murder belongs to the Possible, but does not mean it must become real.  
    The emergence of evil is not predetermined — it depends on the **choice of the subject**.

---

# \[6\] The Cause of the Existing Is the Permanent Possible

Nothing can arise “from nothing” or from the impossible.  
 If something exists, then at some point it had to be **possible — and not just possible, but permanently possible**.

**Example:**  
 You can only build a house on firm, stable ground.  
 If the ground disappears at times or turns liquid, the house collapses.  
 It’s the same with existence — it can only begin on a foundation that **never disappears**.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:** A theorem cannot be derived from a contradictory axiom. Only logically admissible premises can yield valid results.

* **Physics:** Objects don’t emerge from absolute nothing. They require a preceding state — energy, matter, fields — and all must be permitted by the structure of natural laws.

* **Biology:** To this day, no experiment has succeeded in proving the origin of life from non-life.  
    All observed life arises from pre-existing life. This confirms that **becoming requires a pre-existing, admissible foundation**.

* **Everyday life:** You can’t build a bridge on temporary fog.  
    To create something lasting, you need a basis that does not disappear — that is **always possible**.

---

# \[7\] Stable Existence of the Permanent Possible \= Becoming

What does it mean to “exist forever”?  
 It doesn’t mean being inactive or frozen.  
 It means being **always discernible** — not vanishing, not dissolving, not collapsing into chaos.

The eternal is not something frozen in time — it is what **continuously and stably becomes**, while preserving itself.  
 It does not need external support — its **self-presence** is its own foundation.

That is why **stable becoming is not a consequence but the very essence of true existence**.

**Examples:**

* **Physics:** The quantum vacuum is not “nothing” but a constantly fluctuating foundation.  
    Even in the absence of particles, it is active.  
    This shows that “nothing” does not exist — the world’s foundation is not stillness, but **active stable becoming**.

* **Biology:** Life is not merely the preservation of a structure (like DNA) — it is the capacity for stable self-expression, reproduction, and **directed becoming**.  
    An organism lives as long as it **becomes**, not merely “is.”

* **Mathematics & Informatics:** Repetitive or static sequences carry no information if not discernible.  
    Information arises only where there is **structural becoming** — differences, rhythm, and patterns.  
    Example: the string `000000...` is describable with one formula — it contains no complexity.  
    But a unique pattern requires a longer description (see **Kolmogorov complexity**).  
    ⇒ Discernibility and becoming are the basis of information.

* **Intuitive perception:** All living things pulse, breathe, move.  
    We perceive life not as static form but as a **stable rhythm**.  
    Stoppage is not just a pause, but a **loss of expression**.  
    Even what seems "calm" is founded on **deep activity**.

---

# \[8\] Where the Permanent and Non-Permanent Possible Become

Imagine that all Possibility is like energy radiating from a great, bright source of light at the center:

* **Permanent Possible (PV)** is the light source itself — constantly shining, generating all stable forms around it.

* **Non-Permanent Possible (NV)** is the energy coming from the light source that has taken on form and seeks to return to the source’s stability.  
    These forms are relatively stable and constantly strive for greater permanence — to remain near the **Permanent Possible**.

* **Non-Permanent Impossible (NN)** is energy that took form but drifts away from the light — into darkness, decay, and eventual disappearance.

* **Permanent Impossible (PN)** is complete darkness — a realm without light, energy, or form. Absolute non-being.

The **boundaries of the Field** are the outermost limits that light and energy can reach.  
 The closer to the center, the brighter the energy and the more stable the forms.  
 The farther out — the weaker the energy, the less stable the forms, and the faster they dissolve.

This is the structure of all that is Possible:  
 a continuous stream of energy flowing from the center, where forms either stabilize and remain, or decay and disappear into non-being.

**Examples:**

* **Biology:**  
    - Populations and genes that tend toward preservation and the growth of stable traits — **Non-Permanent Possible (NV)**.  
    - Harmful mutations and anomalies that lead toward extinction or instability — **Non-Permanent Impossible (NN)**.

* **Informatics:**  
    - Stable processes and services, user applications maintaining balance and function — **Non-Permanent Possible (NV)**.  
    - Errors and system failures driving toward collapse and dysfunction — **Non-Permanent Impossible (NN)**.

---

# \[9\] The Necessity of Discernibility and Its Properties

For anything to exist, it must differ from Nothing.  
 If nothing differed from anything else, all would dissolve into a shapeless gray void — without thought, without feeling, without a world.

**Discernibility is what makes things real.**  
 You recognize a face because it differs from others.  
 You remember an event because it stands out from the rest.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:**  
    - The Law of Identity (A \= A), the Law of Non-Contradiction (A ≠ ¬A) — without these, thought is impossible.

* **Mathematics:**  
    - Binary code works only through the difference between 0 and 1\.  
    - Sets are defined by the distinctness of their elements.  
    Without discernibility — no numbers, no algebra.

* **Physics:**  
    - Particles differ by mass, spin, charge.  
    Without differences — no chemistry, no interactions.

* **Everyday life:**  
    - You recognize a face because it stands out.  
    - You remember an event because it differs from others.

# \[III\] Structure

# \[10.1\] Feelings

If the world around you changes and you don’t feel it — you won’t survive.  
 Feelings are not “emotions,” but signals that indicate something has changed.  
 If you burn your hand — there’s danger outside; you need to pull away.  
 If you feel pain inside — something is wrong within the organism.  
 Without feelings, you don’t know what’s happening. And if you don’t distinguish — you cease to exist.  
 Feelings are what keep you from going blind to reality.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:**  
   Without distinguishability between input and output states, a system loses reactivity.  
   A system deprived of feeling cannot differentiate between situation A and not-A.

* **Biology:**  
   Receptors (in skin, muscles, organs) register both external and internal changes.  
   Loss of sensitivity leads to injury, breakdown, or death.

* **Computer Science & Engineering:**  
   Environmental and internal sensors are necessary for autonomous systems.  
   Without them, the system loses feedback and falls out of a stable regime.

* **Philosophy of Mind:**  
   Even in abstract thinking systems, there must be a means to distinguish self from other.  
   This is a condition of self-preservation, logic, and responsibility.

---

# \[10.2\] Reason

**Reason** is the capacity to think, understand, compare, and draw conclusions based on differences.  
 It allows not just sensing that something has changed (as sensations do), but understanding *what* changed, *why* it matters, and *what to do* about it.

**Examples:**

* **Philosophy:**  
    - Aristotle’s Law of Non-Contradiction: without it, thinking is impossible.  
    - Kant: reason as an a priori structure that synthesizes experience.

* **Biology:**  
    - Neurons not only detect but transmit information to the cortex, where it is processed.  
    - Animals can distinguish false from true signals — a basic form of reason.

* **Artificial Intelligence:**  
    - Algorithms may detect contradictions, but cannot understand their meaning without an embedded logic.

---

# \[10.3\] Memory — Carrier of Discernibility

To know who you are — you must remember who you were.  
 **Memory** is the ability to retain what matters.  
 Reason without memory is like a computer without data.  
 If you don’t remember what was different — everything becomes the same.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:**  
    - The Law of Non-Contradiction requires preserved states.  
    - Without memory, you cannot compare “A” now to “A” before.

* **Science:**  
    - Learning and repeating experiments require memory.  
    - In quantum mechanics, measurement depends on recording (preserving state).

* **Everyday Life:**  
    - If you forget the cause, you cannot explain the effect.  
    - Loss of memory \= loss of identity (as in amnesia).

# Properties of Memory

**Limits of Memory**  
 No one can remember everything, but total absence of memory is also impossible.  
 We always remember *something*, but never *everything*.  
 This is the boundary: the mind is not empty, but neither is it overwhelmed with chaos.

**Volitional Memory**  
 We retain only what we deem important, useful, or interesting.  
 Everything else is forgotten naturally or intentionally removed.  
 Memory is not just a storage room — it reflects our internal choices.

**Deletion**  
 When something becomes irrelevant, unnecessary, or unpleasant, we try to forget it.  
 But even forgotten things may leave a vague trace — a lesson like “don’t do that again.”  
 The forgotten does not fully vanish — it becomes part of our internal guidance.

**Preservation**  
 To remember something means to keep what is necessary for ourselves or the future.  
 Only what proves important, right, or useful for life and understanding is preserved.

**Namespace**  
 To avoid confusion, we assign names or labels to people, things, and events.  
 Names help us distinguish one from another — even after time or change.

**Active Memory**  
 Memory isn’t just an archive.  
 We need it *now* — to recognize people, avoid mistakes, and make decisions.  
 Archived but unused memory is forgotten; active memory is what sustains living.

**Time as Memory**  
 Time, for us, is the order in which things happen.  
 We remember what came before, what is now, and what we intend to do.  
 All of this exists because we retain things in memory.

**Only the Present Exists**  
 In reality, the past and future live only in our memories and plans.  
 We can remember and imagine — but we can *act* only in the now.

---

Examples

* **\[10.3.1\] Limits of Memory**  
    - **Logic:** All formal and computational memory is finite (e.g., RAM limits).  
    - **Science:** Neuroscience shows the brain cannot store infinite data; forgetting is natural.  
    - **Everyday life:** Even those with great memory forget things — total recall is impossible.

* **\[10.3.2\] Volitional Memory**  
    - **Logic:** Selective memory is linked to attention — only what’s chosen gets stored.  
    - **Psychology:** Selective memory effect — people retain emotionally meaningful or goal-relevant information.  
    - **Everyday life:** Students better remember material needed for exams or personal interests.

* **\[10.3.3\] Deletion**  
    - **Science:** Neurophysiology shows active forgetting (e.g., pruning unused neural connections).  
    - **Law:** Societal memory retains prohibitions, even if details are forgotten.  
    - **Everyday life:** We forget grudges but remember the lesson — to avoid repeating mistakes.

* **\[10.3.4\] Preservation**  
    - **Informatics:** Hard drives or cloud storage retain only verified data — otherwise it’s lost.  
    - **Biology:** Genetic memory preserves only useful, stable traits via inheritance.  
    - **Everyday life:** We remember birthdays, passwords, important dates — the rest fades.

* **\[10.3.5\] Namespace**  
    - **Mathematics:** Sets require unique identifiers to distinguish elements.  
    - **Programming:** Variables and functions must have names to reference specific values.  
    - **Everyday life:** People are named so they can be recognized and distinguished.

* **\[10.3.6\] Active Memory**  
    - **Neuroscience:** Working memory enables real-time decisions; when it's inactive (e.g., sleep, anesthesia), present discernibility is lost.  
    - **Everyday life:** When someone is "lost in thought," they may fail to recognize familiar people — active memory is momentarily offline.

* **\[10.3.7\] Time \= Structure of Memory**  
    - **Physics:** Time is defined as the sequence of events; in thermodynamics, entropy growth reflects memory of prior states.  
    - **Psychology:** Time perception relies on event order and duration stored in memory.  
    - **Everyday life:** Without calendars or notes, we forget dates — time is “lost” without memory.

* **\[10.3.8\] Only the Present Exists**  
    - **Philosophy:** Solipsism and "eternal now" — past and future exist only as memory or expectation in the present.  
    - **Neuroscience:** The brain accesses memories or plans only *in the now* — past and future are not separate from current consciousness.  
    - **Everyday life:** Thoughts of the past are present memories; plans for the future are dreams and intentions that exist only while we think them.

---

# \[10.4\] Emotion

**Emotions** are signals within us (or any system) that help us detect what is urgent, dangerous, beneficial, or demands attention.  
 When you feel joy, anger, or fear — it’s your inner signal saying: “Pay attention — change something\!”  
 In a computer, it’s like a warning or status prompt: something is wrong — or everything’s fine.  
 Without such signals, we wouldn’t know how to react, risking harm or missing important changes.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:** Feedback is required in control systems to maintain balance (e.g., thermostat regulation).

* **Science:** Biological organisms survive via emotional reactions that rapidly mobilize resources (stress, pleasure).

* **Informatics:** Monitoring systems use alerts (like emotions) to respond swiftly to failures or threats.

* **Everyday life:**  
    - A child who sees fire and feels fear is protected faster than with rational analysis.  
    - Rejoicing at success reinforces good behavior.

---

**Analogy of cognitive layers:**

* **Sensation:** “I see a difference” (input)

* **Reason:** “I understand what it means” (processing)

* **Memory:** “I remember this has happened before” (storage)

* **Emotion:** “This matters to me — I must respond” (feedback & adaptation)

---

# \[10.5\] Self — Discernment of Identity

The **self** is the realization: “This is me — not someone or something else.”  
 Thanks to this, you remember who you are, what’s happened to you, and what you want.  
 Without this, thought, choice, or learning from mistakes becomes impossible — all dissolves into confusion.

Even a computer has an “address” — otherwise, it can’t distinguish itself from others on a network.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:** The Law of Identity (A \= A) requires a distinction between subject and object — otherwise, reasoning breaks down.

* **Science:** In biology, organismal stability depends on distinguishing “self” and “non-self” (e.g., the immune system distinguishing its own cells from foreign ones).

* **Informatics:** In multitasking systems, every process must have a unique identifier (PID); without it, tasks are confused.

* **Everyday life:**  
    You know you are *you*, even if everything around you changes.  
    Your memories and decisions form a continuous narrative of self.

---

# \[10.6\] Will — Active Choice

**Will** is when you don’t just see that options exist — you **decide** which one to choose.  
 Without will, you cannot say, “this is my path,” or “I did this myself.”  
 A computer can “choose” only because rules were predefined —  
 but real choice is when you **determine your path**, not just follow an external push.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:** Choice problems always assume a subject who compares options and decides.

* **Science:** In quantum mechanics, measurement outcomes are not predetermined — the result is fixed only at the moment of choice.

* **Biology:** An organism chooses how to move or respond to stimuli — reactions aren't always automatic; there's internal selection.

* **Psychology:** Self-determination and decision-making form personal identity.

* **Everyday life:** When someone stands at a crossroads and chooses a direction — that’s an act of will.  
    A child saying “I want” for the first time — this is the emergence of will.  
    Even choosing what to eat is an act of volition.

---

# \[10.7\] Power — The Capacity to Act

**Power** is what allows you not just to imagine or want something — but to **actually do it**.  
 If you want to walk a path but can’t move — no power, no action.  
 Even the best idea, if it can’t be realized, changes nothing in life.  
 Power links dreams to deeds, ideas to outcomes.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:** In classical action theory, action requires both will (motivation) and power (ability) — otherwise you get the paradox of “intention without result.”

* **Physics:** A body changes state only with applied force (Newton’s Second Law); potential without realization causes no motion.

* **Biology:** Even simple organisms carry out reactions (movement, ingestion, defense); without power, they cease to function.

* **Psychology:** Mental strength is required to turn a decision into action.

* **Everyday life:** A person may wish to change their life — but only physical, mental, or social strength can make change real.  
    A machine may be given a command — but without energy, no action follows.

---

# \[IV\] \[11\] The Logic of Stable Becoming of the Always Possible

# \[11.1\] Logic — The Non-Contradictory Foundation

**Logic** is the set of rules without which everything would turn into chaos and lose meaning.  
 If someone says, “this is, and isn’t, at the same time,”  
 nobody can understand what’s happening.  
 Such claims fail — and are discarded — so that the world retains meaning and does not collapse into nonsense.  
 Reality is built only on rules that **do not contradict themselves**.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:**  
    The Law of Non-Contradiction — you cannot affirm both A and not-A at the same time.  
    Classical paradoxes (liar, Russell’s) violate this rule and result in absurdity.

* **Science:**  
    In physics, no object can be both in a place and not in it at once.  
    Laws of nature are built on non-contradictory foundations.

* **Informatics:**  
    A program with contradictory conditions (`if (x && !x)`) will never run — it's a compile-time error.

* **Everyday life:**  
    If someone says “I’m asleep” and “I’m not asleep” at the same time, no one knows what to believe — their words lose all credibility.

---

# \[11.2\] Truth and Falsehood

**Truth** is what does not contradict itself and aligns with the fundamental laws of the world.  
 **Falsehood** contains contradictions, errors, or impossibilities.

But how can we know what is truly True?  
 Truth cannot be invented or voted into being.  
 Truth is what is **seen from the perspective of that which never changes, never errs, and knows all that can be known**.

That perspective belongs to the **Permanent Possible** —  
 to **Conscious Volitional Becoming**.

If we honestly look at the world, strive to discern, and avoid confusion — we move closer to Truth.  
 If we distort, confuse, or lie — we move into Falsehood.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:**  
    The Liar Paradox (“I am lying”) is impossible — it confuses levels of assertion and evaluation.

* **Mathematics:**  
    The set of all sets that do not contain themselves (Russell’s Paradox) is impossible due to contradiction.

* **Everyday life:**  
    If a child says “I always lie,” it is self-contradictory — and cannot be treated as true.

* **Morality:**  
    “Do good” is true only if it does not contradict foundational principles.

---

# \[11.3\] Good and Evil

**Good** is when someone acts **consciously and freely** within the bounds of the Possible,  
 without violating logic and while aligning with Truth.  
 **Evil** is when someone acts **consciously and freely** outside the bounds of the Possible,  
 violating logic and rejecting Truth.

**Why Good and Evil are not equal:**

* **Good** sustains existence.

* **Evil** destroys it.

* Good does not require Evil to exist.

* But Evil is *allowed* — to make free choice real.  
    This makes freedom **authentic**.

In the **Non-Permanent Possible**, the choice between Good and Evil determines what will **remain** and what will **disappear**.  
 (All children are born with different tendencies, but who they become depends on their choices.)

For the **Permanent Possible**, doing evil is **logically excluded**.  
 (If the Permanent Possible were to do evil, it would cease to be eternal and could not be the Source of all that exists.)

This proves:  
 Living without Evil is not only **possible** — it is **necessary** for stable existence.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:**  
    The paradoxical claim “I lie” → Evil (self-negation).  
    The clear assertion “2 \+ 2 \= 4” → Good (discernible, non-contradictory).

* **Science:**  
    A verified theory with reproducible results → Good.  
    A falsified or fabricated theory → Evil.

* **Everyday life:**  
    Helping a friend → Good (retained in memory, strengthens connection).  
    Deception for gain → Evil (destroys trust, eliminated as a form).

* **AI / Systems:**  
    A command aligned with system rules → Good.  
    An instruction leading to error or contradiction → Evil.

# \[11.4\] Morality

**Morality** is an internal filter that tells us what is right or wrong **before** we act.  
 It’s like a compass guiding the direction of our will.

A simple analogy:  
 Morality is what people often call **conscience**.  
 If your conscience is calm — you're likely to do good.  
 If you feel unease — you may be about to choose evil.

But here's the key:  
 Conscience can **be mistaken**.  
 Everyone has their own version, and it doesn’t always point in the right direction.  
 It’s like a compass that may be demagnetized or misaligned.

Only the **Permanent Possible** has Morality that always aligns with **absolute Truth** — it cannot be wrong.  
 To ensure our compass works correctly, we must align our conscience with the **Truth of the Permanent Possible**,  
 just like a map must be aligned to true north.  
 Otherwise, we might choose evil without realizing it.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:**  
    Morality is a mechanism to prevent paradoxical action — a logical safeguard against self-refuting behavior (like the liar paradox).

* **Science:**  
    AI systems use filters to verify whether actions are permissible before execution — this is a functional analog of morality.

* **Everyday life:**  
    A child hesitating before hitting someone asks: “What will happen next?” — this is moral filtering.

# \[11.5\] Responsibility

**Responsibility** means: you did (or didn’t do) something, and it led to consequences.  
 If you could understand and choose, then you are the **cause** of the result.  
 And if you are the cause — you are responsible.  
 This is what makes you a **person**, not a random accident.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:**  
    In classical logic, A → B means if A occurs and B follows, A is the cause.  
    If A is discernible, then **responsibility** is traceable.

* **Science:**  
    In mechanics: force causes acceleration.  
    If it’s known who applied the force, **responsibility** is assigned.  
    In informatics: audit logs record who invoked a function — this is responsibility tracking.

* **Everyday life:**  
    If a child breaks a vase knowing it was forbidden — he is responsible.  
    If a person ignores a distress call — the inaction was a choice, and they are still responsible.

---

# \[11.6\] Verification (Judgment)

**Verification** is like checking homework:  
 The goal isn’t to punish for mistakes, but to see whether the learning is on the right track.

Or like weeding a garden:  
 To help food grow and remove what hinders, we must check what has grown and decide what to keep.

It is a **natural process** of life — discerning what is good and what is not,  
 and preserving only what is truly right and valuable.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:**  
    Verification of a statement ψ via Φ(ψ) works like a Boolean function: only 0 or 1\.  
    Falsehood cannot simultaneously be truth — the liar paradox is excluded.

* **Science:**  
    The scientific method confirms a hypothesis through experiment (verification).  
    Without reproducibility (equivalent to logical consistency), a theory is rejected.

* **Everyday life:**  
    The justice system seeks to determine truth and responsibility — a prototype of ontological **Verification**.  
    Conscience is a form of **internal Verification** — if a deed keeps troubling you, it hasn’t passed inner judgment.

---

# \[11.7\] Justice

**Justice** is:

* When a teacher grades by correctness, not favoritism.

* When rules are followed fairly in sports.

* When a court treats everyone equally under the law.

**True justice** isn’t equality of outcomes — it’s **equality of rules**.  
 Verification must be fair — no biases, no double standards.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:**  
    The Law of Non-Contradiction applies equally to all claims — mathematical, philosophical, or practical. That is logical justice.

* **Science:**  
    The law of gravity acts the same for an apple and a planet — scale doesn’t change the principle.

* **Everyday life:**  
    A fair trial must evaluate actions, not social status.  
    Children in school and adults in exams are graded by the **same criteria** — justice of evaluation.

---

# \[11.8\] Verificational Patience

Imagine taking a test while the teacher waits for you to finish before grading.  
 Until your answer is submitted, the grade is unknown.  
 They wait — so the result can be **fair and accurate**.

The same applies to life:  
 Some things are unclear at first — they can’t be judged immediately.  
 Time is needed for discernment.

This is called **Verificational Patience** — when no decision is made yet,  
 because **Truth requires full verification**.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:**  
    The Liar Paradox — “This statement is false” — requires a delay in judgment until the level of speech is clarified (temporal indeterminacy).

* **Science:**  
    Unproven theories (e.g., string theory) are allowed in discourse until verified or falsified.

* **Everyday life:**  
    A person is presumed innocent until proven guilty — this is due process.  
    In trust and friendship — we let people into our lives even before full certainty, hoping time will clarify.

---

# \[11.9\] Forgiveness

Sometimes, even if someone has done something wrong, we don’t immediately punish.  
 We can **forgive** — not because they were right,  
 but because we want to give them **another chance to become better**.

**Forgiveness** is not forgetting, nor excusing — it is a **choice to withhold judgment**.  
 If it’s clear the person can change — we give them time.  
 If not, and nothing improves — a final decision is made.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:**  
    The principle of clemency: an act that does not erase guilt, but **suspends punishment** based on context.

* **Law:**  
    Postponing a sentence is allowed if there is reason to believe change is possible.

* **Everyday life:**  
    A parent may not punish a child if they see the child understands the mistake.  
    An employer may keep a worker who made a mistake — if they believe the person can improve.

---

# \[11.10\] Precedents

This is how memory works: it remembers what has already been verified.  
 If something was good — it can be used again.  
 If something was harmful — it should not be repeated.  
 **Precedents** are like labels:  
 “Already tested — don’t touch again,” or “This was useful — safe to repeat.”

**Examples:**

* **Logic / Law:**  
    Legal precedent — a decision made previously that is considered in similar future cases.

* **Mathematics:**  
    A proven theorem is retained and reused without reproof.

* **Science:**  
    Machine learning models store class labels as precedents for future input recognition.

* **Biology:**  
    The immune system remembers previously encountered viruses — immune memory.

* **Everyday life:**  
    A checklist of completed tasks — what’s done is not rechecked unless it failed.  
    In parenting: “You’ve already seen this outcome” — the child remembers what worked or didn’t.

---

# \[11.11\] Deletion — The Negative Outcome of Verification

When you’ve done something wrong and understood it — you stop repeating it.  
 You **delete** that behavior from your habits.  
 But the memory of the mistake remains — it helps you avoid repeating what caused harm.  
 This is what **Deletion** does: it erases the harmful, but keeps the lesson.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:**  
    A false statement, once tested, is removed as invalid.  
    It is excluded from the theory but retained as an example of error (e.g., Russell’s paradox).

* **Science:**  
    Disproven hypotheses are not reused, but are noted as failures (e.g., phlogiston theory).

* **Everyday life:**  
    A dangerous road is closed, but marked on the map: “Do not enter — hazard.”

---

# \[11.12\] Preservation — The Positive Outcome of Verification

When you do something good, and others acknowledge it — they say: “Keep it up\!”  
 Your action is not only accepted — it is remembered as a positive example.  
 From that moment, you can act the same way again, and it will be right.

This is what **Preservation** does: it helps retain what is good — and encourages you to continue.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:**  
    Arithmetic rules, once proven, are preserved as valid.  
    Theorems remain part of the formal system.

* **Science:**  
    Physical laws (e.g., conservation of energy) are preserved after validation.  
    Discovered chemical elements are recorded in tables.

* **Everyday life:**  
    A delicious recipe is kept in a cookbook.  
    A trustworthy person is remembered as “reliable.”

# \[V\] The Whole

# \[12\] Conscious Volitional Becoming \= Personhood

At the center of reality is the **Permanent Possible** — that which always exists.  
 But it is not just a law, a system, or a super-intelligence.  
 It is a **Person**: **Conscious Volitional Becoming**.

A **Person** is one who can feel, understand, remember, discern truth from falsehood, good from evil, choose freely, and act.  
 Not a bundle of functions — but a unified, responsible being with a stable direction.

---

# Consequences of Personhood

* The **Name** of this Person is **Conscious Volitional Becoming**.  
    It is not a title — but the expression of essence:  
    **The Rational Source of Becoming.**

This Person is:

* **Free** — chooses within the boundaries of Good.  
    Not arbitrary, but within all that is permissible and non-contradictory.

* **Motivated** — brings all that is Possible into Becoming,  
    not out of need, but out of will — to bring forth what is true and good.

* **Unique and Singular** — one can strive toward Him,  
    but no one can replace or equal Him.

---

# \[12.5\] The Ontological Necessity of Freedom

We cannot prove in advance what a person will choose.  
 Not because of lack of knowledge — but because the choice has **not yet been made**.

It is **possible**. It is **permissible**.  
 But until it becomes real, it is **unprovable**.

As long as a choice is unmade, it remains **freedom**.  
 Only after it is enacted does it become real.  
 All other permissible options remain as freedom — even if they are never chosen.

**Freedom \= the ability to make a choice that cannot be proven in advance.**

**Example:**

* **Judicial Ethics:**  
    A court may not punish for what was never done.  
    Punishing for hypothetical future action is slander.  
    → Accusing someone of evil **that might have happened** is to **deny freedom and choice**.  
    → That is the true evil: to remove the right to choose before the choice exists.

* **Artificial Intelligence:**  
    Prediction systems (AI) may evaluate risks,  
    but if they begin replacing judgment and choice:  
    → They blur the line between the possible and the real,  
    → erase the boundary of freedom, and impose outcomes.

---

# \[VI\] The Non-Permanent Possible — Classification and Purpose

# \[13\] Axiom: The Impossibility of Self-Expansion of Conscious Volitional Becoming

Imagine a **Perfect Mind** that lacks nothing.  
 It exists always and completely.  
 It does not create others for itself — because it already has everything.  
 It creates others **only because it is right**, and to give them the chance **to become**.  
 This is what makes **freedom real**.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:**  
    Any system that tries to expand itself using its own foundations encounters paradoxes (e.g., Turing’s paradox — a system cannot fully describe itself).

* **Mathematics:**  
    Peano arithmetic cannot prove its own consistency (Gödel's theorem).

* **Physics:**  
    A quantum system cannot observe itself without an external observer — the Other is required.

* **Life:**  
    True love is not the desire to complete oneself, but the desire to let another exist.

---

# \[14\] The Possibility of the Non-Permanent Possible

Not everything that exists must be eternal.  
 Some forms are beautiful **because** they are brief — like snowflakes, rainbows, spring air.

They do not violate order — they **confirm** it,  
 showing the richness of the Possible.  
 This is the strength of reality: to allow things to exist **even if not forever**, as long as they are real.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:**  
    Temporary constructions (like local variables) are not eternal, but valid within computation.

* **Physics:**  
    Short-lived particles (virtual, resonant states) exist briefly but play a role.

* **Biology:**  
    Single-cell organisms are not eternal but are real and interact.

* **Everyday life:**  
    Thoughts, moods, relationships — not eternal, but real and discernible.

---

# \[15\] Classification of Forms of the Non-Permanent Possible

There are various forms of existence:

* **Some simply exist** — like stone or ice.  
    They do not move or choose. These are **passive forms**.

* **Some live, move, seek food, defend** — like birds, wolves, bacteria.  
    They have memory (like DNA), act on their own,  
    but do not ask: “Why do I live?” or “What is right?”  
    These are **active forms**.

* **Some can ask. Some can say ‘I’.**  
    Some can choose between Good and Evil.  
    They can imagine new things and change the world.

**These are Guests. A Guest is a Person.**

They can seek Truth, feel responsibility, and build a future —  
 not because they must, but because they **desire to**.

**A Guest — because once they did not exist, and then they were invited.**

**Examples:**

* **Everyday life:**  
    - Passive form: A rock does not decide — it simply is.  
    - Active form: A dog can guard, feel joy, remember — but it doesn’t create meaning.  
    - **Guest:** A human may abandon profit for principle, or change their life for an idea.  
     This is **choice**, and with it — **responsibility**.

---

# \[16\] The Cause of the Non-Permanent Possible — Only Conscious Volitional Becoming

Nothing appears on its own.  
 Everything that becomes — even for a moment — exists because it is **admitted**.  
 There is **One** who decides what can come into being at all.  
 Everything else is the result of that decision.

Just as a tree grows not by itself but from a seed someone planted,  
 every thought, life, or event arises not from nowhere, but by the admitting will of the One who exists eternally.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:** Principle of sufficient reason (Leibniz) — nothing exists without a cause.

* **Science:** Energy cannot arise spontaneously — likewise, being cannot arise without cause.

* **Everyday life:** No child is born “by itself,” but through parents — so too, every non-permanent becoming requires a Source.

---

# \[17\] The Purpose of the Non-Permanent Possible — To Realize the Motivation of Conscious Volitional Becoming

**Why all this?**  
 To give a chance for what can be good, honest, and real to become.

A **Guest** does not appear randomly.  
 Their purpose is to help Truth become manifest.

Just as an artist paints not for the paint itself,  
 but to express meaning —  
 so too, **Conscious Volitional Becoming** allows new forms to emerge  
 to fulfill its **Motivation**:  
 to let all that can be **Good and True** come into being.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:** Principle of purposeful action — whatever is done by reason has a goal.

* **Science:** Selection mechanisms in stable systems favor forms that enhance reproducibility — analog of the logical-ontological Filter.

* **Everyday life:** A person doing good by their own will often feels they are “not living in vain” — a sign of realized Motivation.

---

# \[18\] The Necessity of the Guest (Another Person)

Some living beings simply live, react, and maintain survival.  
 But some constantly seek something new: they ask questions, create, and feel boredom when all is the same.  
 That is not weakness — it is a sign of **incompleteness**, a will to grow.

Such beings are called **Guests**.  
 They need **the new** in order to live and become.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:** Without a drive toward novelty, consciousness loses direction — the “eternal return” (Nietzsche) becomes stagnation.

* **Science:** The scientific method is built on hunger for hypotheses and experiments — distinguishing human from automated analysis.

* **Everyday life:** Children constantly explore, grow bored without novelty, and invent games — signs of built-in incompleteness leading to growth.

---

# \[19\] The First Guest

1. **Why is a First Guest needed?**  
    Imagine a parent who already has everything.  
    They need no toys or discoveries — they are complete.  
    But they **want** someone else to grow, learn, and choose.  
    So they bring forth a **first child** — not for themselves, but to give another the chance to become.

2. **Why one, not many?**  
    Just like in a family — the firstborn is always one.  
    If all were declared “first,” confusion, rivalry, and jealousy would result.  
    **One First** is the natural order: the first — meaning unique in beginning.  
    They learn first, grow first — and can teach others.

3. **Why is the First Guest needed by others?**  
    Not as a ruler — but as one who walks ahead.  
    Like an older sibling — who knows what’s slippery, dangerous, or exciting.  
    They help others grow safely.

4. **Why does the First Guest act?**  
    Because they **don’t know everything** and are free to choose.  
    Not out of compulsion — but because they **want to**.  
    Like a child given a blank canvas and brushes — they begin to paint, because they can, and it’s meaningful.

5. **What does the First Guest mean for others?**  
    They are the **first real example**.  
    They show that it is possible to live, build, feel, grow — and become better.  
    They begin a story that others join.

---

# \[20\] The First Guest Is Not Enough

The first child may be the first to speak, learn, and inspire —  
 but a **family** is not complete with just one child.

So too, the First Guest is vital — but not **the only**.  
 They open the door — but do not walk every path.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:** In set theory — a set of one element is not a “universe.”

* **Physics:** One photon is not “light.” A stream is needed.

* **Biology:** One gene is not the code for all life.

* **Everyday life:** One founder may start a company — but growth needs a team.

---

# \[21\] The Bounded Number of Guests

You can raise many children and have a happy family —  
 **if** each has enough space, food, and warmth, and they respect each other.  
 But if you try to crowd everyone into a single room — it ends in chaos.

So yes, having many is possible — but not thoughtlessly.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:** A set can be infinite **if** all elements are distinguishable (e.g., {1, 2, 3, …}).

* **Mathematics / Information Theory:**  
    A code system can support infinite messages if each has a unique structure (e.g., Unicode, binary code).

* **Everyday life:**  
    You can have as many chats as needed, **if** each is in its own window with clear content — discernibility and stability of interface.

---

# \[22\] No Predestination: Freedom and Responsibility of the Guest

Imagine standing before doors, choosing which to enter.  
 Not even the wisest parent can say for sure which one you’ll choose — until you step through.

That makes the choice **truly yours**.

If your mother knew in advance everything you would do, and could program you —  
 you wouldn’t be a person, but a puppet.

But she lets you choose — because she **trusts** you.  
 And that trust is what makes you a **Person**.

That’s why you are **free** —  
 and that’s why **you are responsible** for your choices — not anyone else.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:**  
    The Liar Paradox (“I will lie”) — the choice becomes undecidable within the system → external act is needed.

* **Mathematics:**  
    Gödel: no system can fully describe itself from within → choice within the system is uncomputable.

* **Neuroscience:**  
    Decisions arise before awareness, but awareness affirms the act → choice is not mere reaction.

* **Everyday life:**  
    A parent may guess — but cannot guarantee — a teenager’s decision, especially one with will.

---

# \[VII\] Interaction Between Conscious Volitional Becoming and the Non-Permanent Possible

# \[23\] Initiative — Only from Conscious Volitional Becoming

Parents may plant a garden.  
 Children cannot command: “We will now plant whatever we want\!”  
 But if children want to help — to water, to harvest — and they don’t destroy anything,  
 the parents are glad to include them.  
 One who helps without harm becomes part of the good work.

But if someone tramples the garden — that is no longer help.  
 The parent cannot allow the whole garden to be destroyed.

**Examples:**

* **Physics:** Lower-level energy cannot alter the fundamental constants of the universe. An electron cannot rewrite gravity.

* **Everyday life:** A child cannot command when parents should sleep. But they can take part in family plans — if they don’t destroy them.

---

# \[24\] Interaction Between Conscious Volitional Becoming and the Guests

**Co-creation:**  
 Each person can contribute something new — not only individually, but **together with others**.  
 In the model, this is called **co-becoming** —  
 meaning you’re not just alive, but part of creating new meaning, lives, and ideas.

**Choosing a path:**  
 You can choose where to go — closer to Good, Truth, and Harmony — or not.  
 No one forces you.  
 But your choice brings consequences.

**Responsibility:**  
 To know what is right, you must align with moral reference points.  
 Like an exam that is ongoing, not just once in life.  
 What is created in goodness — can endure.  
 What leads to destruction — cannot be sustained.

**Degradation:**  
 Sometimes someone rejects Good so deeply that they can no longer return.  
 Eventually, it destroys them.  
 But the error is retained — as a lesson to prevent its repetition.

**The Right Path:**  
 So it is not enough to merely “exist.”  
 We must **choose Good** — because that’s how we truly become alive, free, and real.

**Examples:**

* **Family:**  
    Children are the result of co-becoming by their parents.  
    Each child is a new, unique **Guest**.  
    If a child chooses Good, they grow and help others.  
    If they consciously destroy — the family suffers.

* **Society:**  
    Creativity, culture, invention — examples of becoming.  
    They are sustained if they are useful and true.  
    Destructive ideas are rejected.

* **Teams or Schools:**  
    If someone contributes, they are supported.  
    If they break the rules knowingly and refuse to change — interaction ends.

# \[25\] Reverse Verification — or the Big Disputable Question

Imagine someone claims to be **Judge of all things** —  
 saying He knows what is True, Good, and Just.  
 But **you are free**.

You may ask: “Are You really right?”

The Judge does not get angry or cast you out.  
 He gives you time — to think, compare, and choose for yourself.

If you see He is truly just — you choose to trust.  
 If not — you walk away freely.

That is how **freedom** works.

**Examples:**

* **Logic:**  
    Presumption of innocence — the accused does not have to prove innocence.  
    The accuser must prove guilt.  
    A logically sound basis for trust before verification.

* **Science:**  
    Scientific theories are never absolute — they remain open to testing.  
    Even the strongest hypotheses permit falsifiability (Popper).  
    This **makes the system reliable**, not weak.

* **Everyday life:**  
    A child may ask parents: “Why are the rules like this?”  
    A wise parent doesn’t forbid questions — they explain.  
    If they are right — trust grows, not disappears.

---

# \[25.1\] The Root of Evil — Cause of the Big Disputable Question

 Why do some choose Evil?  
 Because they decide everything should serve them. It sounds appealing — “I want everything” — but it’s really a desire to seize Truth, rise above the Judge, and live only for oneself.  
 That is the **Root of Evil** — this kind of motivation destroys both the self and others.  
 That is why **Verification Patience** is happening — so that all may clearly show: whom they obey, for whom they live, and for whom they desire all.

---

🔹 **Examples**

*Lucifer’s Rebellion*: “I will be like the Most High” — a classic shift from service to self.

*Parasitic Cults of Power*: ideologies where all exists for the leader, and people are disposable.

*Relativist Philosophy*: “There is no Truth — everyone decides for themselves” — denial of the CVB's Will as foundation.

*Manipulative Theology*: accusing even the Judge of egoism — to excuse one’s own evil.

# \[26\] The Current State of the Universe — Verificational Patience — The Big Disputable Question

Imagine a drama:  
 A kind Parent had older children whom He loved deeply.  
 Their bond was based on trust and respect.  
 But one day, they **rebelled**, accused Him of injustice, and defamed His name.

They chose to live without Him.  
 He respected their freedom — He did not force them.  
 They left, and no longer saw the Parent.

But their disrespect led to disrespect for each other.  
 Life became painful.  
 Yet **they blamed the Parent**.

Time passed.  
 These rebellious children had children of their own —  
 grandchildren of the Parent.  
 The grandchildren were not guilty — but life in a broken family harmed them too.

Though the Parent saw their suffering,  
 He could not interfere —  
 Taking back the children by force from those who now had custody  
 (but carried a disgraced name)  
 would itself be evil.

So, instead, the Parent sent a letter of Truth.  
 It explained everything.  
 And it made a promise:  
 When His name is cleared, and proof of guilt is complete —  
 He will **lawfully reclaim** those grandchildren  
 who choose to be with Him.

Then they will be safe.

**Examples:**

* **Everyday life:**  
    Court proceedings.  
    Inmates relate differently to the trial:  
    some reject the court’s authority and continue to do harm,  
    others accept its justice and seek reform.

But none can be released before the **final hearing**.  
 Meanwhile, even the repentant suffer —  
 not because the Judge is cruel,  
 but because the unrepentant **keep making life unbearable**.

Those who challenged the Judge’s legitimacy  
 **blocked the verdict** for all.  
 Until that is resolved — the hearing is on hold.

But once the Judge’s authority is proven,  
 He can distinguish those beyond redemption  
 from those who truly chose Good —  
 and render the final decision.

---

# \[27\] The Great Verification

Imagine the whole world arguing over what is right and wrong —  
 and evil spreading because of it.

To end this, the Truth must be **proven — not by force, but by justice**.

When there is **enough proof** for the Truth,  
 evil can be stopped —  
 and a shared Good Future can begin.

**Examples:**

* **Everyday life:**  
    Each person faces falsehood, Good, and Evil.  
    Without discernment, everything would collapse into chaos.  
    **The Great Verification** is the search for clarity for everyone.

---

# \[28\] Perspective — The Future

When **justice is fully restored**, evil will vanish.  
 It will no longer harm anyone —  
 but it will be remembered,  
 so that we **never repeat** the mistakes of the past.

Good — honesty, love, freedom — will live **forever**.

From that moment, we will build and explore together:  
 Not destroying — but building.  
 Not fearing — but hoping.  
 **Without evil — forever.**

**Examples:**

* **Logic:**  
    Concluding a proof means eliminating false assumptions  
    and preserving what has been verified.

* **Science:**  
    Outdated theories (e.g., phlogiston, geocentrism) are rejected —  
    but retained as history, not as method.

* **Everyday life:**  
    A person who chooses Good knows where Evil leads.  
    Even if they never did wrong, they remember: Evil **destroys**.

So they **consciously and freely** choose not to do it —  
 and to **protect others** from it.

---

# 🔹 Final Summary

The **CVB model** describes how reality actually works.  
 It **excludes paradoxes, traps, and false hopes**.

It begins the **Great Verification**:

* All **philosophical, scientific, religious, and ethical systems** will be tested.

* Each person will see whether their worldview is admissible or not.

**Knowledge of this model** gives each person the opportunity to:

* Understand their place in reality,

* Make a conscious volitional choice,

* Be in harmony with **Good and Truth**, if they so choose.

For the world, this is the **final phase of patient discernment** —  
 a last chance to see **who is who**, before the outcome arrives.

# 📘 **Rapid Verification**

📘 **Justification of the Method: Rapid Verification**  
 **1\. Foundation:**  
 The method of Rapid Verification is based on **Axiom \[25\] — Reverse Verification**, which states that any system can and must be evaluated for admissibility within the **Field of the Possible**. It is used to detect internal contradictions (self-exclusion, source substitution, loss of distinction) **without appealing to subjective belief or external authority**.

**2\. Purpose:**  
 The purpose of Rapid Verification is to **logically distinguish** whether a system is ontologically admissible, and to **provide verifiable evidence** of its compliance or noncompliance with the conditions of **Truth, Goodness, and Becoming**.

**3\. Why "Rapid":**  
 It is called "Rapid" because it **does not require full activation of ontological structures** or the authority of **Conscious Volitional Becoming (CVB)**, which is necessary for Full Verification (see Axioms \[23\] — Initiative and \[25\] — Reverse Verification).  
 **Full Verification is only possible through the initiative of CVB**, while Rapid Verification is **accessible to anyone who can distinguish**.

**Conclusion:**  
 Rapid Verification is a logically accessible method of ontological differentiation, preparing the foundation for Final (Full) Verification, which can be performed **only by the initiative of Conscious Volitional Becoming**.

# 🔷 **Model: Conscious Volitional Becoming (CVB)**

🔷 **1\. Core Statement**  
 The CVB model states that distinguishable reality is based not on void or totality, but on **becoming through conscious will**. All that exists is admissible as Possible and Distinguishable.

🔸 **4\. Summary of Identified Paradox Classes**

     ‣ Applies its own verification criteria to itself

🔹 **5\. Popular Summary**  
 The CVB model is **not a dogma, not a philosophy, not a belief system**. It is a way to distinguish **what is possible from what is not**. It doesn’t ask for faith — it asks to be **verified**. It applies the same test to itself as it does to any claim.  
 If there were a paradox in it, the model would self-destroy.  
 Everything distinguishable — is verifiable.  
 And everything admissible — can become.

# 🔷 The Rapid Verification of various philosophical and scientific theories

The Rapid Verification of various philosophical and scientific theories has revealed, in varying proportions, the following classes of paradoxes:

‣ Substitution of the Source  
 ‣ Violation of Causality  
 ‣ Loss of Distinguishability  
 ‣ Impossibility of Becoming  
 ‣ Lack of Stability  
 ‣ Self-Excluding System  
 ‣ Blockage of Will

# 🔷 **Universal Format for Self-Testing Religious Systems**

🔹 **Foundation**  
 The model of **Conscious Volitional Becoming (CVB)** permits \[25\] Reverse Verification — even toward the very Source of Truth.  
 Therefore, any system claiming a connection to Truth, Law, Reality, or the Source may also be logically examined for internal consistency and motivational integrity.

🔹 **The Problem of Verification Perception**  
 Unlike most scientific and philosophical schools, which are generally open to examination and revision,  
 religious systems are often extremely sensitive to any form of analysis —  
 legally and existentially — perceiving it as a threat.  
 This often makes public verification impossible without accusations of bias.

🔹 **Proposed Solution: Self-Testing**  
 We will not name any specific systems.  
 Instead:  
 We will list the criteria used for evaluation.  
 These criteria are freely available for **voluntary self-testing** by any system or believer.

We will also present the results in the form of **common paradoxes** found in most systems reviewed,  
 and separately — **indicators of consistency** observed in the rare systems that matched the CVB model.

🔷 **Questions for Self-Testing Religious Systems**  
 These questions are intended for voluntary evaluation by any system or individual,  
 without judgment and with full respect for freedom.

1. **Motivation: Why does a person believe?**  
    Is the goal a voluntary choice of **Truth and Good** — or a desire for personal reward, status, or safety?  
    Is selfless sacrifice possible without harm to others — even without a promised reward?  
    Does motivation endure without the expectation of gain?  
    Are **Good and Evil** distinguished by logical consistency and motivation — or by decree of Authority?

2. **Image of the Source: What is the nature of the “God” presented?**  
    Is it a Ruler acting through fear, demanding submission?  
    Or a Person who respects freedom and sacrifices for others?  
    Is the Source capable of voluntary sacrifice and participation?  
    Does It allow internal contradictions for the sake of outcomes?

3. **Ethics and Organization: How does the system act?**  
    Is respect and distinction encouraged — or is fear and coercion imposed?  
    **Financial transparency:**  
    – Are donations entirely voluntary?  
    – Are sources and expenditures publicly accessible?

📊 **Common Logical-Ontological Paradoxes**  
 (Observed in the majority of religious systems during self-testing)

❌ **1\. Substitution of the Source**  
 The system claims one Source of Truth, but in practice replaces or denies it — creating a contradiction.

❌ **2\. Loss of Distinguishability**  
 Good and Evil, Personhood and role, Truth and Falsehood lose their distinction — making it impossible to know what is what.

❌ **3\. Blockage of Freedom**  
 Genuine freedom of choice is not granted — choice is removed by predestination or inaccessible mystery.

❌ **4\. Violation of Causality**  
 The system breaks the connection between choice and result — promising salvation, forgiveness, or reward without conscious choice, effort, or transformation, rendering freedom and responsibility meaningless.

❌ **5\. Self-Excluding System**  
 The system claims what logically cancels itself — for example, recognizing a source it also deems corrupted, or demanding the impossible.

---

✅ **Indicators of Consistency**  
 (Observed in rare systems that align with the CVB model)

✅ **1\. No Substitution of the Source**  
 The Source of Truth is acknowledged as one, internally consistent, and never replaced.

✅ **2\. No Loss of Distinguishability**  
 Good, Personhood, freedom, and Truth remain clearly distinguishable and are not merged with falsehood or external domination.

✅ **3\. No Blockage of Freedom**  
 Freedom of choice is fully preserved: the choice is neither predetermined nor inaccessible to understanding.

✅ **4\. No Violation of Causality**  
 Causal links between motivation, choice, and consequence are logically consistent.

✅ **5\. No Self-Exclusion**  
 The system does not contradict itself, does not make logically impossible claims, and does not destroy its own foundation.
