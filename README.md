# Model of Conscious Volitional Becoming (CVB)
Formally definable, logically verifiable, 
and ontologically complete system of distinguishable reality  

## What is CVB?
   For millennia, humanity has searched for answers:
> **Who are we? Why are we here? What is Truth?**
Sciences, philosophies — all have offered fragments.  
But none have eliminated paradoxes or united consciousness, 
freedom, and morality into a coherent whole.
   **CVB is the first model to achieve that — not 
by speculation, but by formal, paradox-resistant logic.**  
   For the first time, we can say not:
      “I believe”, but: “I know.”
